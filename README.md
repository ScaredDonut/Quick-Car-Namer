# Quick-Car-Namer
A simple PHP script that gets data from your database and outputs a text on a page to rename your FiveM cars to something else.


Simply run this on your web server, change the appropriate details for the connection and save the file. Visit the file via a web browser and copy and paste it to your client.lua.
Don't forget to make a fxmanifest.lua with the appropriate info.
